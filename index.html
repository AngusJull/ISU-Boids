    <br>
    <p>This website was created to showcase <i>boids</i> creatures which follow three basic rules: </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Align</li>
    <li>Avoid</li>
    <li>Approach</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    To sum it up: Align tells the boids to try and move in the same direction as other boids near it, Avoid tells boids
    to try and avoid collisions with other boids, and Approach tells the boids to try and move to the center of where other boids are.
    <br>
    <br>
    These rules give rise to intriguing flocking behaviours.
    </p>
