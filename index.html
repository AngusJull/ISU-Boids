    <h3 id="subtitle">Introduction</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This website was created to showcase <i>boids</i> creatures which follow three basic rules: </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Align: Match the speeds and directions of other boids</li>
    <li>Avoid: Stay out of a certain range of other boids - try not to hit eachother</li>
    <li>Approach: Get close to the average position of other boids</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
	Each boid looks around it, finds the boids near it, and finds the direction it needs to move in to follow the three rules as best it can.
	Interestingsly, these simple behaviours create complicated flocking - a life simulation.
	</p>

	<br>
	
	<p>
	Boids and their rules were first defined by Craig Reynolds in 1986. Birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects are all common examples
	of creates which follow the same rules. These simple creatures may look useless and trivial, but interestingly they do have applications 
	in the real world.
	</p>

    <h3 id="subtitle">How To Use</h3>
    <p>
	The simulations below should open automaticaly and start automaticaly as well. By moving the sliders you can alter the 
	strength of the boid rules, the number of boids, and other perameters. Try to observe each rule in action. 
	</p>

	<h3 id="subtitle">Applications</h3>
	<p>
	These creatures do have applications beyond simulations on websites:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Flocking behaviours like boids used to simulate flocks and realistic movement of any sort of animal in animation</li>
	<li>Flocking and boids have been used to simulate human movement in crowds, showing that even a change in the direction of
	5% of people was enough to change the direction of the entire group, or that in avoiding certain people a crowd would behave 
	like a school of fish</li>
	<li>The boid rules have been used for partical swarm optimization, in something called Boid Partical Swarm Optimization</li>
	<li>Boids have been used for visualising data</li>
	<li>Boids have even been used to 
	</ul>
