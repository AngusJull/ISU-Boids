		<h1>Boids : Simulated Flocking</h1>
		<h3>By Angus Jull</h3>
    	<br>
    </header>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<br>
	
    <p>This website was created to showcase <i>boids</i>, simple creatures which follow three basic rules: </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Align: Match the speed and direction of other boids</li>
    <li>Avoid: Move away from other boids which are too close</li>
    <li>Approach: Get close to where most boids are</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Each boid looks around it, finds the boids near it (within a certain view range), and finds the direction it 
	    needs to move in to follow the three rules as best it can.
	    Interestingsly, these simple behaviours create complicated flocking behaviours like those seen in nature. 
	</p>
	<p> Boids and their rules were first defined by Craig Reynolds in 1986. The rules have been observed in 
	    nature and are what we consider the core rules of flocking. These simple creatures may look useless and trivial, 
	    but interestingly they do have applications in the real world.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>How To Use</h3>
    <p> The simulation below should start automatically (it may take some time to load). By moving the sliders you can alter the 
	    strength of the boid rules to see each of their effects. <b>Changes will take some time to have a visible effect. Have some patience</b>

	<h3>Applications</h3>
	<p>These creatures do have applications beyond simulations on websites:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Flocking rules have been used to simulate flocks and realistic movement of any sort of animal in animation</li>
		<li>The same rules that boids use have predicted human movement in crowds, showing that even a change in the direction of
		5% of people was enough to change the direction of the entire group, or that in avoiding certain people a crowd would behave 
		like a school of fish</li>
		<li>Boids have been used for partical swarm optimization, in something called Boid Partical Swarm Optimization</li>
		<li>Boids have been used for visualising data</li>
		<li>It has been proposed that unmaned drones follow the same rules as boids</li>
		<li>Somehow, flocking was used to automatically program multi channel radio stations</li> 
		<li>They look really,<i> really, really cool.</i></li>
	</ul>
